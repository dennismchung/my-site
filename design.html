            <p><b>Company:</b> Deliver food/vegetables through subscriptions</p>
            <p><b>Project:</b> Checkout flow for a monthly subscription vegetable delivery service.</p>
            <p><b>Priority one requirements:</b> First and last name, Mailing address, Email address and password (including a password strength meter), Credit card details</p>
            <p>Most of my experiences comes from the user end of the checkout process. But Iâ€™ve never really paid attention in detail how I felt about it. It is a crucial part of the ecommerce process.</p>
            <p>My initial design flow pictured below:</p>
            <a target="_blank" href="assets/images/workflow-sketch.jpg"><img class="design-img small" src="assets/images/workflow-sketch.jpg"></a>

            <p>After doing some research I found that grouping relevant information in chunks creating a proximity between relevant fields (logical order), makes the user focus on one task at a time. Creating a 3 step process makes the checkout seem simple and easy. If there is one page it will feel overwhelming because there is too much information on one page.</p>
            <p>I also debated of adding a back to previous feature because although android and iOS phones have a static back button that pops up from a swipe. I think giving the user a visible option to go back gives them reassurance.</p>
            <a target="_blank" href="assets/images/create-account.png"><img class="design-img smaller" src="assets/images/create-account.png"></a>
            <p>The first part of the journey is the login details page. This part requires basic information Email and Password. Since the minimum requirement requires a password strength I also thought about showing/adding rules to making the password stronger along with the password strength meter. E.g. Must contain one capital letter, number, special character..etc. </p>
            <a target="_blank" href="assets/images/billing.png"><img class="design-img smaller" src="assets/images/billing.png"></a>
            <p>The second page Billing/Shipping Details has  a pretty basic and traditional layout. For the shipping section I added the option to use the same as the billing address. Just in case there are cases where the billing address differs from shipping address. If it is the same I added a checkbox to auto fill the information. Maybe have it automatically go to the next page if the checkbox is engaged.</p>
            <a target="_blank" href="assets/images/payment.png"><img class="design-img smaller" src="assets/images/payment.png"></a>
            <p>The card info page has the basic information.</p>
            <a target="_blank" href="assets/images/review-subscription.png"><img class="design-img smaller" src="assets/images/review-subscription.png"></a>
            <p>I added a review subscription page because I was not sure if the user knew exactly what they were getting. This allows them to review the order and place the order with confidence and giving a trusting experience.</p>
            <a target="_blank" href="assets/images/thank-you.png"><img class="design-img smaller" src="assets/images/thank-you.png"></a>
            <p>A brief thank you message and an option to go back to the user accounts page.</p>
