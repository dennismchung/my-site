          <p>CricDuel is a fantasy sports contest that allows Cricket lovers to play daily, as opposed to a lengthy season. Matching a pair of players to enter into a draft picking system gives each player the opportunity to pick the ultimate team for that match. CricDuel is unique and allows players to create one-of-a-kind team. This allows for a much more even playing field between the entry level beginner and the long time playing cricket lover.</p>

              <p>is it <b>intuitive?</b></p>

          <p>A majority of the users based in India and had 360 x 640 resolution.

          <p>
            We created documentation for the visual design requirements to hand off to the engineer. This document contained style guides, component library and design specifications to help as the application grows the next designer/developer could user as a reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            I modeled the system after Googles <a href="https://material.io/design/">Material Design</a> System. Paired with using Abstract we created a live and shareable component library. Abstract does a pretty good job simulating version control and it’s specifically for design teams!

          <h3><a id="Design_System_74"></a>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Doing a redesign and managing a design system is really difficult. Given the 8 week timeline, redesign and 2 new features it was really hectic in managing the components. Different teams would be making or changing components and their use cases.</p>
            <p>Abstract + Material Design, I definitely would trim down unused symbols components as soon as possible, running sketch plugin: symbol organizer on the material design library slows down the process tremendously.</p>
            <p>Have multiple reviewers on the design system team. I was the sole reviewer of component and other changes done. This took up too much time especially when deadlines became tighter. However as much as it was hectic it was really cool creating a system that was evolving into something tangible and usable.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed making the detailed interactions and animations. When a developer is able to see the whole process down to the animations I know it makes their life a little easier! </p>
