                Slack is a team collaboration tool used by companies to communicate through direct, group and channel messaging. There are plenty of team based communication apps on the market  that compete with Slack, but I feel personally this is the easiest one to use, gets what I want done the fastest and it is the most intuitive.
                It keeps the familiar Instant messaging application design that many are familiar and comfortable with. If you look at popular instant messaging apps there is usually a list of contacts on the side bar. Slack has taken the design and enhanced it with efficient use of colors, shapes and typography.
              </p>

                The way Slacks layout is designed you can see there is a distinct use of proximity. Groups, Channels, Direct Messages are easily recognizable and distinguished.  It allows it to be used simply as a direct messaging tool or for multi team collaboration. Just by looking at the contact sidebar you are able to recognize it. Very intuitive.

                The main window opens up whatever active (direct message, channel, groups) the user focuses on.  The main chat box has a lot of information, but it is designed efficiently so that the user does not feel overwhelmed. The spacing and proportion of each element is enough for the user to know itâ€™s there, but not have it be in the way.

                The search bar opens up another sidebar scaling down the main tab, but the spacing again is made so that all 3 areas are visible and accessible.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the main appealing things to me about Slack is the design. At a glance the slack app looks appealing and trustworthy. With good use of contrasting colors and group proximity to help distinguish sections of the app, the use of shapes (or lack thereof) and simple use of typography (bold, non-bold, opaque, highlighted) improve the usability.
