          <p>Over the last 3 years the NexTravel product has grown organically based on customer requests and feedback. Our team was tasked to redesign the information architecture and site navigation.</p>
          <p>My role as a product designer for our client involved User interviews, Usability Testing and Card Sorting to better understand the user archetypes for Nextravel. As a team member I designed sketched, and made Lofi/Hifi prototypes for responsive web. I also conducted User testing and iterated off our results to make a more efficient Information Architecture and usable interace. </p>
